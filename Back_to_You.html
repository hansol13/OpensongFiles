  <div class="lyrics">I'm sorry, Lord, for the heir I've become</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I never thought that I would be this far from home</div>
  <div class="lyrics">All the love you gave never lied in waste</div>
  <div class="lyrics">It keeps me hanging on</div>
  <div class="lyrics">When I look around and there's nowhere else to run</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">These filthy hands I lift in faith</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Longing for redeeming grace</div>
  <div class="lyrics">To cleanse my heart and bring me back to You</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">Bring me back to You</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I'm so undeserving of the love</div>
  <div class="lyrics">You so freely offer us</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I will place my trust in You and never look back</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Because of who You are, because of what You've done</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">Forgive me, Lord, for my ungrateful heart</div>
  <div class="lyrics">When I thought that I would be better off alone</div>
  <div class="lyrics">When deception came, thought I had the strength to fight foolishness away</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I forgot where all my strength comes from</div>
  <div class="lyrics">These filthy hands I lift to praise</div>
  <div class="lyrics">A holy God with loves that saves</div>
  <div class="lyrics">A wounded soul in need of Your embrace</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">Bring me back to You</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I'm so undeserving of the love</div>
  <div class="lyrics">You so freely offer us</div>
  <div class="lyrics">I will place my trust in You and never look back</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Because of who You are, because of what You've done</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">When I see Your open arms of love</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Welcoming Your prodigal home</div>
  <div class="lyrics">There's nothing that can hold me back from You</div>
  <div class="lyrics"></div>
  <div class="lyrics">So I will run</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Yes I will run</div>
  <div class="lyrics">God I will run</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Yes I will run</div>
  <div class="lyrics">To you</div>
  <div class="lyrics">God we will run to you</div>
  <div class="lyrics">Ohhh</div>
